# 🐍 What is Python? (Beginner-Friendly Guide)

If you’re just starting to learn programming, **Python** is a great choice!  
Here’s **what Python is, and how to write some super basic code with it.**

---

## ❓ What is Python?

✅ Python is a **programming language** that is:
- Easy to read and write 📝
- Great for beginners and professionals 🌟
- Used for web development, data analysis, AI, automation, and more 🤖

You write Python code in simple text files, and it runs line by line.

---

## ✍️ Python Syntax and Indentation

✅ **Syntax** means the rules for writing code.  
✅ In Python, **indentation (spaces at the start of a line) is required.**

Bad example ❌
```python
if True:
print("Hello")
```

Good example ✅
```python
if True:
    print("Hello")
```

👉 Always indent your code properly — usually **4 spaces**.

## 📦 Variables and `print()`

✅ A **variable** is a container that stores data.

Example:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name)
print(age)
```

Output:
```
Alice
25
```

✅ Use `print()` to display text or values.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

---

## 🔄 `if`, `for`, `def`, and `return` (Super Quick Intro)

### ✅ `if` — Make decisions
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

Output:
```
x is greater than 5
```

---

### ✅ `for` — Loop through things
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
```

---

### ✅ `def` — Define a function
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

Output:
```
Hello, Alice!
```

---

### ✅ `return` — Send back a value from a function
Inside a function, `return` gives back the result to whoever called the function.

---
