# 🧩 How to Create a Django App (Beginner-Friendly Guide)

After creating a Django project, the next step is to create an **app**.  
Here’s **what a Django app is, and how to create one step by step.**

---

## ❓ What is a Django App?

✅ A **Django app** is a smaller part of your project that handles one specific feature.

For example:
- A `blog` app for blog posts ✍️
- A `store` app for e-commerce products 🛒
- A `base` app for core site features (pages, home, etc.)

You can have **many apps** inside one Django project.

## 🔷 How to Create an App

### ✅ Step 1: Open Terminal Inside Your Project Folder

Make sure you're inside your Django project folder where `manage.py` is.

```bash
cd backend
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run the App Creation Command

Use this command to create an app named `base`:

```bash
python manage.py startapp base
```

✅ This creates a folder named `base/` with files like:

```
base/
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
├── views.py
└── migrations/
```

Each of these files has a specific job:
- `models.py` — define your data (e.g., Product, User)
- `views.py` — write what to show when someone visits a URL
- `admin.py` — connect your models to the admin panel

---

### ✅ Step 3: Register the App

To tell Django you created a new app, open:  
📄 `backend/settings.py`

Then add `'base'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'base',  # 👈 Add this line
]
```

---
