#  React Concept: Components

**Components** are the building blocks of a React application.  
They allow you to break the UI into **small, reusable pieces** that are easier to manage and maintain.

---

## **1. What is a Component?**
- A component is a **JavaScript function (or class)** that returns UI (usually written in **JSX**).
- Components make it easy to **reuse code** and organize your app into logical parts.

---

## **2. Types of Components**
React has two main types of components:

###  **1. Functional Components** (Modern & Recommended)
- Simple functions that return JSX.
- Use **hooks** (like `useState`) for state and lifecycle.

Example:
```javascript
const Greeting = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

---

###  **2. Class Components** (Older Approach)
- Use ES6 classes and extend `React.Component`.
- Contain methods like `render()`.

Example:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello from Class Component!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```

**Note:** Modern React prefers **functional components with hooks**.

---

## **3. JSX in Components**
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

Example:
```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React</h1>
      <p>This is a component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

## **4. Why Components?**
✔ **Reusability** – Create once, use multiple times.  
✔ **Organization** – Break UI into logical parts.  
✔ **Maintainability** – Easier to debug and scale.

---

##  **React App Structure with Components**
Example:
```
App.js
Header.js
Footer.js
```
```javascript
// App.js
import Header from "./Header";
import Footer from "./Footer";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main><p>Main Content</p></main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

###  Summary
✔ Components are **functions or classes** that return JSX.  
✔ **Functional components** are preferred in modern React.  
✔ They make React apps **modular, reusable, and scalable**.
